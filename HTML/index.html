    <h1>Welcome to My Page</h1>
    <p>Hello, I'm Tabita, a student at McHenry County College, where I'm diving into the exciting world of Mobile App Development. It's quite a leap from my previous career in the medical field, where I proudly became a registered nurse (RN) in 2012, later specializing in anesthesia in 2014, all while studying in Pakistan. Now, I'm embarking on this new adventure of studying in the USA and immersing myself in the fascinating realm of computer science.</p>
    
    <h2>My Programming Journey</h2>
    <p>I started my coding adventure by learning Python, which introduced me to the world of programming logic and problem-solving. I'm currently delving into SQL database management, which is essential for storing and retrieving data efficiently. HTML and CSS are helping me create stunning web pages, and I'm also exploring Swift Playgrounds to create apps.</p>
    
    <h2>My First Project</h2>
    <p>My first major project was in Python, where I created a program called Random Restaurant Generator. The purpose of this program was to help users select a restaurant randomly without wasting time, and deciding where to go. The program had two buttons 'Generate now' and 'Generate again'. The 'Generate now' button randomly selected the name of a restaurant from a list of restaurants. If the user was not satisfied with the first selection, they had the option to 'Generate again'. After the name was randomly generated, the program also showed the menu and prices of the restaurant.</p>
    
    <h3>Currently Working on</h3>
    <p>This semester, I've embarked on the Swift journey, and for my grand finale project, I'm cooking up something special, an app that's an evolution of my trusty Random Restaurant Generator. Picture this: I'm jazzing it up with some fresh features. Brace yourself for the magic, I'll seamlessly integrate Google Maps into the mix. That means, when you're deciding on a restaurant, you won't just get a name; you'll get an interactive experience. Tap on your chosen destination, and voil√†! Google Maps will whisk you away to the restaurant's doorstep. How's that for a tasty upgrade?</p>
    
    <h3>Future Goals</h3>
    <p>My passion lies in making life easier for others, and my future goal is to craft apps that do just that. I'm leaning towards creating apps tailored for the older generation, where I can truly make a difference. Imagine medication reminders that are as reliable as your best friend, or a program tied to a medicine box that only opens when it's time for your dose. Think about how valuable this could be, especially for seniors dealing with mild dementia who might forget if they've taken their meds. It's a simple concept, but it has the potential to change lives. This is just the tip of the iceberg for my future plans, and I'm constantly learning and brainstorming to bring these ideas to life.</p>
