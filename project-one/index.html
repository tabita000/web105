        <h2>Home</h2>
        <p>Hello, I'm Tabita, a student at McHenry County College, where I'm diving into the exciting world of Mobile App Development. It's quite a leap from my previous career in the medical field, where I became a registered nurse (RN) in 2012, later specializing in anesthesia in 2014, all while studying in Pakistan. Now, I'm embarking on this new adventure of studying in the USA and immersing myself in the fascinating realm of computer science.</p>
        <h2>My Programming Journey</h2>
        <p>I started my coding adventure by learning Python, which introduced me to the world of programming logic and problem-solving. I'm currently delving into SQL database management, which is essential for storing and retrieving data efficiently. HTML and CSS are helping me create web pages, and I'm also exploring Swift Playgrounds to create apps.</p>
        <h2>My First Project</h2>
        <p>My first major project was in Python, where I created a program called Random Restaurant Generator. The purpose of this program was to help users select a restaurant randomly without wasting time, and deciding where to go. The program has two buttons 'Generate now' and 'Generate again'. The 'Generate now' button randomly selected the name of a restaurant from a list of restaurants. If the user was not satisfied with the first selection, they had the option to 'Generate again'. After the name was randomly generated, the program also showed the menu and prices of the restaurant. This semester, I've embarked on the Swift journey, and for my final project, I'm cooking up something special, an app that's an evolution of my program, Random Restaurant Generator. Picture this: I'm jazzing it up with some fresh features. Brace yourself for the magic, I'll seamlessly integrate Google Maps into the mix. That means, when you're deciding on a restaurant, you won't just get a name; you'll get an interactive experience. Tap on your chosen destination, and voil√†! Google Maps will whisk you away to the restaurant's doorstep. How's that for a tasty upgrade?</p>
