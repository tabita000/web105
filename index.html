        </h4>
        <p>I like music and I love to play guitars. I have an acoustic guitar, an electric and I recently bought a bass guitar. I am not not a pro and only play at home. I can also play a bit of drums.  </p>
        <h3>Fishing</h3>
        <p>Another recent pastime of mine is fishing. I really enjoy the tranquill efffect of water. I love the outdoors and fishing is a way to unwind from the busy everyday life. Whether is alone or with a group of friends, fishing is where I find my balance and my bliss.  </p>
        <h3>Stand-up Comedy</h3>
        <p>I love funny people, I love good jokes and stand-up comedy brings me an unparalleled sense of joy and laughter. Some of my favorites are Kevin Hart, Dave Chappelle, Anjelah Johnson and Gabriel Iglesias. </p>
