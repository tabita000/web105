    <h2>The character Of Mr.Fox</h2>

    <!--Add a paragraph about whatever your H2 tag was-->
    <p>Mr. Fox delicately induces a call to be confident in one's individuality while also growing and changing with the times.Despite his reputation as a poultry thief, Mr. Fox is a charismatic and likable character. In the movie he leads his community in standing up against the farmers' oppression and injustice. Throughout the story, Mr. Fox's wit and bravery shine, showing his strong commitment to protecting his loved ones and creating a better life for all. </p>

    <h3>My favorite scene from Fantastic Mr.Fox </h3>
    <p>This is one of the last scenes from the film where Mr. Fox meets a black wolf. This wolf and the whole scene can be seen at the eye-
    level by the viewers with fiery yellow eyes, glowing that contrasts black fur which in turn
    sharply contrasts the white mountains behind it. Mr. Fox tries to communicate with this wolf but
    finds out rather quickly that this wolf does not speak French, English, Latin, or any other
    language for that matter so he raises an outward fist up to the wolf to which the wolf reciprocates
    and trots off after the group wishes the wolf good luck. On the surface the scene can be a bit
    confusing and dogmatic and possibly redundant to many viewers but in my opinion this scene
    serves a purpose and I think this is one of the main scenes of this movie. </p>
