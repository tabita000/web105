        <h2>Home</h2>
        <p>Hello, I'm Tabita, a student at McHenry County College, where I'm diving into the exciting world of Mobile App Development. It's quite a leap from my previous career in the medical field, where I became a registered nurse (RN) in 2012, later specializing in anesthesia in 2014, all while studying in Pakistan. Now, I'm embarking on this new adventure of studying in the USA and immersing myself in the fascinating realm of computer science.</p>
        <h2>My Programming Journey</h2>
        <p>I started my coding adventure by learning Python, which introduced me to the world of programming logic and problem-solving. I'm currently delving into SQL database management, which is essential for storing and retrieving data efficiently. HTML and CSS are helping me create web pages, and I'm also exploring Swift Playgrounds to create apps.</p>
